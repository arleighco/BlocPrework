# Bloc Prework

<h2>Assessment Overview</h2>

Once you complete all of the pre-work, you must complete the last two assignments (below) and pass the assessment to continue on within Bloc's Designer Track.

Before we can begin to teach you anything about design, we need to make sure you can set up a basic project and understand some of the language that people in the industry use when working with one another.

To ensure you are ready to make the most of your time in the Designer Track, please complete the following assignments and submit your work to Bloc's Lead Mentor for Design, Chris Courtney.

Upon completion of these assignments, create a folder in Dropbox, and share them with Chris Courtney. If you so choose, you can include the files in a GitHub repository and add Chris (designhawg) as a collaborator.

This assignment is due by 11:59 pm the Thursday before your course is scheduled to begin.

Your assignment will be reviewed and you will receive further instruction the following day to let you know if you have been cleared to begin the course.

<strong>Assignment 1: Working with others via Illustrator</strong>

Please create a single Illustrator file with two artboards.

Artboard 1 should be 1440px x 800px in size.

Artboard 1 should have a box measuring 980px x 300px centered on the page. This box should be on its own layer and have a green stroke of 5px. On a second layer called Typography, please enter your name and set it to 30pt in size. Below your name, enter the city and country in which you reside and set the type to 18pt in size. Align the city/country type with the right edge of your name. Group your typographical elements together and center the grouped elements in the center of the box you created.

Artboard 2 should be 512px x 512px in size. Inside this artboard, you should have a layer dedicated to Artboard 2 that contains a red circle that is 480px in size and proportional. This red circle should be aligned to the bottom right of the artboard.

<strong>Assignment 2: Setting up a basic web page</strong>

Please create a simple web page containing the following elements:

First, open a text editor (Sublime Text or Brackets are suggested to use) and create a project folder named Prework.

Inside of your Prework folder, create two files:

index.html
style.css
Within the index.html file, add the standard html, head, and body tags.

Within the head tag, include a title tag with your name between the opening and closing tags. Insert a link to your style.css stylesheet.

For the body tag, include an h1 tag, and insert your name between its opening and closing tags. Below, add an h3 tag that includes the city and country in which you reside.

Within the style.css file, change the background of the entire html file to green. Target the h1 tag, and add 100px of padding to the top of the element. Finally, center all text on the page.
